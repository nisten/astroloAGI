This is a random fun project to use the openai api for astrology readings. 


The project uses openai whisper in webassembly for speech-recognition and also provide a natural language search interface for astrology questions. 

The project also uses indexedDB for offline storage of data in order to provide a privacy conscious astrology resource for those that desire one so.

Cheers,

p.s. 10xer has been volunteered for this project.
